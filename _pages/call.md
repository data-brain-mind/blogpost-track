## Call for Blog Posts

We invite researchers and practitioners to contribute **tutorial‑style, educational posts** that support the *Data on the Brain & Mind* community. Suitable submissions include:

1. **Dataset Walkthroughs** – step‑by‑step guides on accessing or preprocessing emerging neuroscience / cognitive‑science datasets.  
2. **Method Tutorials** – clear explanations of ML/AI techniques tailored to neural, multimodal, or graph‑structured data.  
3. **Critical Reflections** – lessons learned, data quirks, pitfalls, or reproducibility tips specific to heterogeneous neuro data.  
4. **New Perspectives** – conceptual or theoretical insights that spark interdisciplinary dialogue.  
5. **Negative or Null Results** – cool ideas that didn’t pan out (and why), so others can learn.

If you’re unsure whether your idea fits, email us at  
<a href="mailto:data-brain-mind@googlegroups.com">data‑brain‑mind@googlegroups.com</a>.
