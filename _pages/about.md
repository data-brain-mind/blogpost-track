# Data on the Brain & Mind Workshop - Blogposts Track
**Concrete Applications of AI to Neuroscience and Cognitive Science**

## Overview

The Blogposts Track complements our *Data on the Brain & Mind* workshop at NeurIPS 2025 by soliciting **tutorial‑style, educational blog posts** that help the community work with emerging, heterogeneous neuroscience and cognitive‑science datasets.

Large‑scale, open datasets now span:

- **Whole‑brain circuitry:** FlyWire, IBL, WormID  
- **Visual–motor cortical processing:** MICrONS  
- **Human development:** BabyView  
- **Natural speech processing:** MEG‑MASC  

These data are far from standard ML benchmarks; they include time series, images, videos, text, and complex graph structures, each with distinctive meta‑information (e.g., MEG electrode coordinates). Blog posts should demystify such datasets, share best practices, and highlight tailored AI solutions beyond one‑size‑fits‑all models.

## Call for Contributions

We invite posts that, for example:

- Provide step‑by‑step guides to accessing or preprocessing a dataset  
- Walk through ML methods tailored to neuro/cognitive data  
- Offer critical reflections on data quirks or lessons learned  
- Describe collaborative tooling across ML, neuroscience, and cognitive science

**Accepted posts** will appear on the workshop blog and feature in a **poster session** at the workshop.
